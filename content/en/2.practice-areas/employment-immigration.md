We offer solutions that fuel business growth, spark innovation, and set our clients up for long-term success.

Whether it's negotiating and drafting employment agreements, managing individual or mass terminations, safeguarding intellectual property, enforcing non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, or ensuring compliance with data protection laws and internal policies, we provide strategic, solutions-driven counsel tailored to your needs, backed by deep expertise. In transactions, we conduct thorough due diligence across all industries, assessing compliance with employment law, pension fund obligations, social security requirements, and workplace health and safety standards - helping businesses mitigate risk and navigate complex transitions with confidence.

To attract and retain top talents, we guide our clients to design and implement compelling incentive plans, including share purchase programs, stock options with tailored vesting schedules, and bonus retention schemes. Our team ensures these plans are both legally sound and strategically optimized - maximizing their impact while maintaining compliance with tax and social security regulations. We secure work and residency permits and assist foreign residents in the negotiations of lump-sum tax regimes in Switzerland.

We advise Swiss and internationally operating companies on social security obligations and pensions.
