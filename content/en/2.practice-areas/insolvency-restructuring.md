We bring extensive experience in navigating complex domestic and cross-border restructuring and insolvency matters, both in and out of court. Whether representing creditors or debtors, we deliver strategic, results-driven counsel to safeguard our clients' financial interests in high-stakes situations. 

We also assist our clients in identifying and mitigating insolvency-related risks through meticulous transaction structuring and contract drafting. Our team frequently advises creditors in pre-insolvency enforcement scenarios, ensuring they are well-positioned to protect their claims before financial distress escalates. 

Banks and financial institutions rely on us to secure and enforce their claims effectively. We provide comprehensive guidance on asset protection, recovery strategies, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring creditors can maximize recoveries in complex financial situations.
