::anchored{on="h2" title="Insolvency and Restructuring"}

We have extensive experience in representing creditors and debtors in complex domestic and cross-border (in-court and out-of-court) restructuring and insolvency proceedings. We also assist our clients in identifying and addressing insolvency related risks through appropriate structuring of transactions and contract drafting, and often counsel creditors in pre-insolvency enforcement scenarios. We also provide advice to banks and other creditors in connection with the securing and/or enforcement of their claims. If and when bankruptcy authorities are involved, we represent insolvent companies and creditors in the context of a liquidation, composition and restructuring.

Our work includes:

- Representing creditors in Swiss insolvency proceedings
- The renegotiation of all contracts with suppliers, service providers, clients or credit providers and banks
- Advising companies in (out-of-court and in-court) restructuring and refinancing proceedings, including the tenure of the position of curator in companies which have applied for a moratorium
- Advising creditors and debtors on the implementation of cross-border restructuring schemes
- Advising clients on enforcement procedures with the aim of safeguarding the rights of creditors, including attachment of assets located in Switzerland
- Assisting creditors in pre-insolvency enforcement scenarios and analyzing the risks of enforcement and challenges to security in insolvency scenarios
- Advising board members and management of companies in need of financial restructuring
- Representing purchasers and sellers of distressed debts
