Innovative, dedicated, fast, and hands-on, we take a business-oriented approach to every transaction and act as transaction facilitators. Partnering closely with our clients, we deliver tailored, high-quality advice – where it matters most.

## M&A Transactions
Our team serves as lead counsel or special Swiss counsel, structuring complex cross-border and domestic M&A transactions. We can take a lead role in your transaction, forming cross-practice groups to cover general corporate, governance, regulatory, finance, employment, and pension matters as needed. From strategy to execution, we manage the entire process seamlessly.

We advise a diverse range of clients, including multinational corporations, private equity and venture capital firms, SMEs, family offices, directors, managers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Our expertise spans acquisitions, leveraged buyouts (LBOs), management buyouts (MBOs) and buy-ins (MBIs), mergers, corporate restructurings, divestitures, spin-offs, and joint ventures across all industries.

## Private Equity
We provide comprehensive support to private equity investors across all industries in both domestic and complex cross-border transactions, navigating every aspect of private equity investing, including minority investments, management and leveraged buyouts, financing solutions, sales and exits. Our integrated team - comprising experts in corporate law, financing, employment and benefits, real estate, and post-M&A disputes - ensures that every private equity deal is structured for success, from entry to exit.

## Venture Capital and Start-ups
For start-ups and university spin-offs, efficiency is vital. Vision, expertise, enthusiasm – and tireless determination and perseverance, we combine our in-depth understanding and fine expertise to help tackle tough challenges encountered by new businesses. We work closely with founders to ensure that start-ups get it right from the start from protecting intellectual property, navigating through capital raises and convertible debt financing rounds, to stakeholder governance. Our team also designs employee benefits and incentive plans that attract and retain top talent. We guide entrepreneurs through every stage of the start-up lifecycle - from seed funding to growth financing, all the way to successful exits through trade sales or acquisitions.
