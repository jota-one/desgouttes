## Estate Planning | Wealth Structuring
At the heart of our Private Clients practice is a commitment to fostering long-lasting relationships with high-net-worth individuals and families we advise. We deliver expert guidance and bespoke solutions across all aspects of global estate planning and wealth structuring. We simplify complexity, ensure compliance, and deliver long-term value, safeguarding your legacy for future generations. In addition, we handle dispute resolution with efficiency and sensitivity, ensuring a smooth and thoughtful process.

## Legacy and Succession Planning | Inheritance Disputes
We help individuals and families shape meaningful legacies and create sustainable, long-term impact across generations. Our team has extensive expertise in complex succession planning - both domestic and cross-border - and in the transfer of all asset types, including real estate, financial holdings, art collections, and family businesses.

We work closely with our clients to document their wishes with precision, whether the priority is securing a spouse or partner's future, preserving family wealth, or ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of assets. We also advise on the organization of family wealth transfers and the design of governance frameworks to foster clarity, alignment, and efficiency between generations.

As trusted executors of wills and administrators of estates, we ensure that estate transfers are handled smoothly and in full accordance with the deceased's intentions - minimizing complexity and easing the burden on heirs.

We are also highly experienced in leading complex, multi-jurisdictional inheritance litigation, and arbitration. We coordinate legal strategies and represent both Swiss and international clients in contentious matters.

## Pre- and Post-Nuptial Agreements
Relocating to or from Switzerland? We review and adapt marital agreements, estate plans, pension arrangements, and tax strategies to ensure they comply with the legal frameworks of your new country of residence.

Our practice includes art lending, collateral arrangements, and navigating import/export and customs regulations.
