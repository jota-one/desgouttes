## Banking Litigation, Regulatory Investigations and Enforcement Proceedings
Banking and financial institutions are important actors of the Swiss economy. In their daily dealings they sometimes face crisis situations and disputes that must be managed with discretion and efficiency. We have robust experience in handling such disputes whether through negotiation or litigation. We also have extensive experience in both avoidance as well as the successful handling of difficult investigations and proceedings involving supervisory and judicial authorities. Our core activities encompass:
- Civil and criminal representation of banks and other financial players
