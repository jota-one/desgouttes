Des Gouttes & Associés has decades of experience in litigation and international arbitration in Switzerland, in both practice areas as counsels and as deputy judges or arbitrators. We represent clients in complex civil, administrative and criminal litigation, international arbitration and corporate investigations. Our clients cover a broad range of industries, including banking and finance, aviation, automobile, information technology, outsourcing, pharmaceutical, construction, fast moving consumer goods, art and education. Across these sectors, clients rely on our understanding of their business needs and our fine grasp of the technical and scientific disciplines at the core of their operations.

We approach each matter with thoroughness and creativity. Des Gouttes & Associés' distinctive features, including cost-effective and target-oriented case handling with teams tailored to the specific size and requirements of each individual dispute, make us a preferred choice as counsel.

Determined to win our clients’ cases, we equally strive – whenever appropriate – to explore favorable amicable solutions to the issues at stake, with as little disruption to business as possible.


## Litigation
We represent clients for commercial, corporate, banking, wealth management, inheritance, and employment disputes in Switzerland. We have a strong record of success in all of these areas, as well as in many others. The firm is also frequently retained to act in regulatory enforcement matters and white-collar criminal investigations.

Further, several lawyers of our firm are former deputy judges at the Geneva courts, hence providing them an in-depth knowledge from inside the judiciary.

We also represent clients in embargo matters and political freezing of assets before the Federal authorities.

With many of our lawyers who are native Swiss-German speakers, we are in an effective position to defend our clients’ interests before courts and authorities both in the German- and French-speaking Cantons of Switzerland. Moreover, we have a long and successful track record in litigation before the Swiss federal courts and administrative authorities, including appeals before the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.

## Arbitration
Switzerland is a renowned center of international arbitration. Over time, legal disputes and proceedings have become increasingly complex and require the highest level of expertise and sensitive handling. Our experience enables us to provide our clients with the support they need.

We are regularly involved in international arbitrations, either as counsel for a party or sitting as arbitrators. Our arbitral practice is mainly focused on institutional arbitration and, in particular, arbitrations conducted under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration Institution, the London Court of International Arbitration and the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The firm is also regularly involved in UNCITRAL and ad hoc arbitrations.

In every case, we establish a tailor-made team prepared to provide the highest quality of work, with the utmost commitment and focus at every level. Our multilingual team is able to communicate with clients and conduct cases in English, French, German, and Italian.
