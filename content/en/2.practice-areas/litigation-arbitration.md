## Litigation
With an excellent reputation as litigators, we act in banking and finance litigation for large corporations and individuals, advise in shareholders' litigations, wealth management and inheritance disputes. We provide expert guidance across a wide spectrum of disputes, ranging from employment and inheritance matters to complex commercial and corporate issues, with specialized experience in sectors including aviation, automotive, information technology, outsourcing, pharmaceuticals, construction, fast moving consumer goods, art, and education. Our team of experts is also frequently retained to act in high-stakes regulatory enforcement matters and white-collar criminal investigations, as well as to represent clients in complex embargo matters and political freezing of assets before the Federal authorities. Across these sectors, our clients rely on our understanding of their business needs and our fine grasp of the technical and scientific disciplines at the core of their operations.

Several lawyers of our firm are former deputy judges at the Geneva courts, hence providing them an in-depth knowledge from inside the judiciary.

With many of our lawyers who are native Swiss German speakers, we are in an effective position to defend our clients' interests before courts and authorities both in the German- and French-speaking Cantons of Switzerland. Moreover, we have a long and successful track record in litigation before the Swiss federal courts and administrative authorities, including appeals before the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.

## Arbitration
Switzerland is a renowned center of international arbitration. Over time, legal disputes and proceedings have become increasingly complex and require the highest level of expertise and sensitive handling. Our experience enables us to provide our clients with the support they need.

We are regularly involved in international arbitrations, either as counsel for a party or sitting as arbitrators. Our arbitral practice is mainly focused on institutional arbitration and arbitrations conducted under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Swiss Arbitration Center, the London Court of International Arbitration and the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The firm is also regularly involved in UNCITRAL and ad hoc arbitrations.

In every case, we establish a tailor-made team prepared to provide the highest quality of work, with the utmost commitment and focus on every level. Our multilingual team conducts cases in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
