Defending your interests. Protecting your future. In today's rapidly evolving global landscape, governments are intensifying their fight against fraud, corruption, money laundering, and the financing of criminal and terrorist activities. With stricter laws and heightened enforcement, criminal law has become a pivotal force shaping international business and finance. Navigating this complex environment requires strategic expertise, decisive action, and a deep understanding of cross-border regulations. 
:::

Our firm provides strategic, hands-on defense for clients facing complex criminal, civil or administrative investigations conducted by federal, cantonal or local authorities. At every stage of the process, we stand firmly by our clients, ensuring their rights and interests are rigorously protected.

For international clients with assets in Switzerland, we offer expert guidance in navigating cross-border legal complexities. Whether facing foreign government requests for information, freezing assets, or document disclosures following mutual legal assistance requests, we provide clear, decisive strategies to safeguard assets and mitigate risk.

Beyond defense, we work closely with banks and financial institutions to build and refine robust compliance programs that align with the latest regulatory requirements. By proactively strengthening their frameworks, we help them mitigate legal exposure and reputational risk in an increasingly scrutinized financial landscape.

In addition, we regularly assist victims of fraud and financial crime to recover stolen assets and bring those responsible to justice before the Swiss criminal authorities and to obtain rightful compensation and/or restitution.

In that regard, we are a member of the International Fraud Group ([www.internationalfraudgroup.com](//www.internationalfraudgroup.com)), a global network of highly competent specialists equipped with everything it takes to trace, freeze, seize, secure and return assets.
