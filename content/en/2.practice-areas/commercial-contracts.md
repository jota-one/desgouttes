::anchored{on="h2" title="Commercial and Contracts"}

From dynamic small- and mid-sized enterprises to international corporations, we support businesses across the full spectrum of commercial activity. Our deep sector knowledge, strategic insight, and key understanding of risk factors ensure that we craft the most bespoke contracts.

Whether launching a new business, structuring partnerships, or navigating complex commercial challenges, we provide expert guidance tailored to our clients' needs. We specialize in establishing and structuring business operations in and out of Switzerland, and we are equipped to tackle any commercial or contractual issue businesses may encounter. With deep expertise in traditional contract law, we offer end-to-end support, from drafting and negotiations to implementation and enforcement of all types of commercial contracts.

For companies operating in regulated industries (such as banking and financial services, life sciences and healthcare, etc.), we go beyond legal advice - we help manage the full spectrum of regulatory, commercial, and compliance matters to keep your business running smoothly. No matter the challenge, we take a collaborative, solution-driven approach, carefully assessing all options before recommending the best path forward.
